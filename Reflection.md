# Reflection on Joystick Project
### Challenging
I found the operation of the joystick challenging as I had never used a joystick before in Arduino. 
I went to YouTube to find the answer to this problem, and with the help of a couple of videos, I was
able to control the LEDs using the joystick inputs. [This video helped me with the joystick.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rabTZfnc-bY&t=120s)

### Learn More About
I want to learn more about the functions of different input and output devices, maybe looking into 
an electronic device like an LED screen or LCD screen.
